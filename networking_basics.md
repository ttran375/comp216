# Networking Basics

## Networks

1. **Medium for Signals**:
   - **Wired**: Utilizes physical cables such as Ethernet, coaxial cables, and fiber optics.
   - **Wireless**: Employs radio waves, microwaves, and infrared signals (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).

2. **Bandwidth**:
   - Refers to the data transfer capacity of the network, often measured in bits per second (bps).

3. **Protocols for Network Traffic**:
   - Rules and conventions for data exchange across the network (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP).

4. **Network Size**:
   - **Local Area Network (LAN)**: Covers a small geographic area like a single building.
   - **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: Spans a city or campus.
   - **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: Covers a broad area, such as multiple cities or countries.
   - **Personal Area Network (PAN)**: Connects devices within the reach of an individual, typically within a few meters.

5. **Topology**:
   - The physical or logical arrangement of network devices.
     - **Star Topology**: All devices connect to a central hub.
     - **Bus Topology**: All devices share a common communication line.
     - **Ring Topology**: Devices are connected in a circular manner.
     - **Mesh Topology**: Devices are interconnected, providing multiple paths for data.

6. **Traffic Control Mechanism**:
   - Techniques to manage data flow and avoid congestion (e.g., Quality of Service (QoS), traffic shaping).

7. **Organizational Intent**:
   - **Intranet**: A private network accessible only within an organization.
   - **Extranet**: A private network that grants controlled access to external users.
   - **Internet**: A global network connecting millions of private, public, academic, and governmental networks.

By understanding these classifications, one can better design, implement, and manage networks tailored to specific requirements and objectives.

### Features of Networks

1. **Generality**
   - **General-Purpose Resources and Services**: Networks are designed with versatile resources and services to support a broad spectrum of applications. This includes hardware like routers, switches, and servers, as well as software such as operating systems, network protocols, and application software.

2. **Multi-Perspective**
   - **Supporting Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**: Networks are equipped with services to meet both the functional needs (like data transfer, file sharing, communication) and non-functional requirements (such as performance, reliability, security) of various applications.
   - **Administration and Management**: Effective networks include tools and systems for managing and administering the network. This encompasses user access management, network monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintenance.
   - **Optimization**: Networks are optimized for various parameters:
     - **Cost**: Minimizing the expenses associated with building and maintaining the network.
     - **Performance**: Ensuring high-speed data transfer, low latency, and high availability.
     - **Scalability**: Ability to expand the network easily to accommodate growing amounts of traffic or additional devices.
     - **Security**: Protecting the network and its data from unauthorized access, breaches, and other threats. This involves the implementation of firewalls, encryption, secure access controls, and regular security audits.
